    "# CHROMOSOME\n",
    "First we need to come up with a way to represent the problem with a chormosome: We assume that there are num_rows + 2 nodes placed on plain labeled start, end, and 1 to num_rows. Then ants should comeup with a path from the start node to the end node, possibly passing through some intermediary nodes on their way. If an ant passes through the i-th node, it means that in the corresponding solution to the set covering problem we want to include the i-th set. Since it doesn't matter what order the ants visit the nodes in, we assume that the do it lexicographically based on the indices. Thus a chromosome is a binary array of size num_rows, showing which nodes the ant took on its trip."
